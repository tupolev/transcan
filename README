Transcan is a Java command line tool to gather translatable strings from source code files and dump them into XLIFF
files.

Features:
-Can filter the file types to be scanned for strings
-Can use custom patterns for scanning, stored as Regex in the config.xml file.
-Can specify included/excluded directories to scan.
-Can separate the translation strings into different XLIFF files, using output prefixes.
-Can add new translation strings to existing XLIFF files, or create new files after each scan.

Build:
Clone the project and build using "ant -f transcan.xml" or just download the file "transcan.jar".

Run:
java -jar transcan.jar <project_config_xml_file>

It will load the configuration from the mandatory project config xml file.
